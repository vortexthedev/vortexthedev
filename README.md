About me:
Hi, I am a Java developer from Lithuania, but I speak Russian and English.
I never participate in projects without motivation and the necessary knowledge from the team.

My main portfolio:
- VortexSpigot (Extremely optimized tacospigot fork 1.8.8 [Spigot is private, contact me])
- VortexPearls (The best enderpearl plugin)
- TrapeClient (External cheat client for Minecraft [Looking for C++ dev, contact me])
- VLoader (Mongo/MySQL license system with automatic patcher and loader for JAR files
- I've worked with JavaFX, JSwing and can easily make a custom GUI.
